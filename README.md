# Welcome to my Page

Hello! :wave:

I'm Luke Hunter-Salmons, an enthusiastic and ambitious Software Engineer based in London, England. I recently completed an intensive 4-month bootcamp with HyperionDev, where I gained hands-on experience in a wide range of programming languages and technologies.

During the bootcamp and various online courses, I successfully built projects across various domains, including software development in Python and SQL, web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, web apps with React.js and Node.js, and object-oriented programming. I also gained proficiency in using Git/GitHub and worked with Django.

I'm passionate about leveraging my skills to develop innovative solutions and I'm excited to continue exploring new technologies and contributing to impactful projects.
